## Instructions 📌

Implement a responsive web page (look at the end of the page)

**Goal: Implement the current web page in a responsive manner.**



The only dynamic part of the page will be having a slider instead of a static image right below the header (a set of elements (each one consisting of an image and a  description that will be shown one after one after a certain amount of time with the possibility to show the previous or the next element by clicking on a button on the left or a button on the right (use a left arrow for the button on the left and a right arrow for the button on the right)).

### Evaluation criterias 📝 :

* The Layout of the page 
* The semantic of the page 
* The responsiveness of the page 
* The dynamic slider using javascript
* Code clarity 

You will need to upload the solution to github and share the repository link with me, you are free to use the fonts, the text and the images that you won’t and you will not be judged on that.

⚠️⚠ The usage of any css or javascript libraries or frameworks is forbidden. ⚠️⚠️
